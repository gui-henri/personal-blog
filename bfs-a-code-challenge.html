                <strong>Abstract:</strong>
                <p>
                    In this article, i talk about how i implemented a desktop app, made with Go and Raylib, that
                    visualizes the
                    Breadth First Search algorithm. I also talk about the challenges i faced and the things i learned.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <p>
                    I once had an algorithm class in college. There, i saw many approaches that could be used to solve
                    countless problems. It was nice, but it turned out being boring. The main reason behind this lied on
                    my
                    teacher, that tried to make me learn dozens of algorithms and how they work, but not even once
                    talked
                    about how they were implemented.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>What is a hashmap?</i>
                </p>
                <p>Oh is just when you throw a value into an hash function and then store it accordingly.
                </p>
                <p> <i>Great, now how you would implement it? </i>
                </p>
                <p> Eh...
                </p>
                I just couldn't. It was all up to me if i wanted to learn those things. Truth is, not a single soul
                would encourage me to do that. Most of my college friends are now employed, and none of them remember
                what a red-black tree is useful for. I'm pretty convinced that i don't need that to survive this world,
                but still, the thought that i can't do it, even if i wanted, haunted me. So i decided that it was my
                turn to implement a cool algorithm and make a video about it.
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h3>The initial thoughts.</h3>
                <p>I knew i could do just a terminal based app in python and call it a day. I knew i could use any game
                    engine to render graphics. But i'm a masochist and i was ready for a challenge. I saw a Tsoding
                    stream
                    using Raylib and i thought it would be a good idea to use it. In Go, of course, because i use
                    windows,
                    and i hate C++ on windows.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To my luck, just recently the Go bindings of Raylib received an update. Now, you don't have to
                    recompile
                    Raylib everytime you compile your program, you can type [set cgo_enabled=0] on your terminal and
                    paste
                    the Raylib .dll into your project folder. It was that easy to setup everything, i was ready to
                    action.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Chosing what algorithm to implement was also easy, but the story behind it is very interesting.
                    During
                    one of the classes, the teacher started to belabor about A* algorithm. He talked a lot about the
                    math
                    behind it and how it could be used to solve a rubik's cube. It was a shame thought, that he forgot
                    to
                    teach how it worked (to be fair, he mentioned an heuristic function, but only in a vague and
                    mathematical way).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some weeks later, i found a video on Youtube showing a pathfinding visualization using A*, and
                    instead
                    of finding it funny, i was filled with rage. Why the teacher didn't showed something like this? I
                    would
                    have comprehended it much better than with that crazy math. Not to mention that by looking the
                    video, i
                    could clearly have an idea of how it would be implemented. That night, i picked up my pride and said
                    to
                    myself: "i'm going to make that shit".
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the article, i asume you know what A* is. If you don't, worry not! Here's the wikipedia page for
                    that: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">A* Algorithm</a>
                </p>

            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>The Works.</h3>
                <p>
                    The first thing i did was to draw a square. Then, i drew some more. And then, i added ui (using
                    raygui) to set the number of squares on the screen. It sounds easy, and it was. Raylib is amazing,
                    and i can't praise it enough by how straightfoward it is. In only a few minutes, i felt like a
                    senior doing magic.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="go">
func main() {
    rl.InitWindow(screenWidth, screenHeight, "Test Window")
    defer rl.CloseWindow()

    rl.SetTargetFPS(60)

    for !rl.WindowShouldClose() {
        // app logic here

        rl.BeginDrawing()
        {
            rl.ClearBackground(rl.Black)

            // draw objects here
        }

        rl.EndDrawing()
    }
}
                </code></pre>
                <p>
                    Despite that, i had some problems when combining it with Go. First we have the type conversions.
                    God,
                    you need to make so many of then. It may be a skill issue, and it wasn't hard to fix, but it sure
                    got my
                    nerves. Second, the performance is really behind the original C version, probably because it goes
                    back
                    and forth between the two languages. It may be a skill issue as well. Also, building the UI was
                    fairly
                    easy, despite bad documentation on raygui for Go.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Right after that, i added the square painting functionality, meaning that i was ready to implement
                    A*.
                    Here, something funny happened: i accidentally implemented BFS in a very clever way. Just before
                    implementing the heuristic function for the A* to work, i added a piece of code like this as a
                    placeholder:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="go">
func (g *Grid) calculateScore(c *Cell) float64 {
    return c.score + 1
}
                </code></pre>
                <p>
                    Not expecting much, i hit play and saw it working first time. I remember stoping for a moment and
                    trying
                    to think why this worked. Realization only came later, that by adding one to the score of each cell
                    in
                    the frontier (i'm calling the squares "Cells", and the frontier are the cells adjascent to the
                    initial
                    cell), checking every single one of then, adding 1 again to each neighbor and repeating was the same
                    as
                    a BFS. I was really happy, because now i could say i implemented two algorithms, when i was only
                    trying
                    to implement one. By it's nature, BFS aways gives the best result, so it also worked as a benchmark
                    about the speed and performance of the A*.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Some bugfixes later, i had the A* working as well. It was tricky because of how bad my code was
                    organized, but i was able to solve it. Overall, the experience was great. I was finally able to
                    learn
                    how the algorithm worked under the hood and i still managed to learn some Raylib in the proccess! As
                    final touch, i added sounds for each step of the algorithm and recorded some videos. Here's the BFS
                    one,
                    which sound the best.
